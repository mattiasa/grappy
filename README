This package is a postfix policy daemon which implements grey listing
functionality. This is just one of many implementations. More
information on the greylisting techique is available at
http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/index.html

This script can be found at
http://www.stacken.kth.se/~mattiasa/projects/greylist-daemon-python/

Features of this implementation are:

1) Written in python, which makes the code short and readable.
2) Uses a mysql database back end, which makes it suitable for cluster
   mail server environments
3) Written for high performance environments. It uses threads and a
   database connection pool for high throughput

There are a number of configuration options which are listed in the
script.

The table structure is listed in create_base.sql. Two tables are
required. One for the greylist which contains all triplets, and one
for the whitelist which contains one column each for ip, sender
address and recipient address.

Whitelist:

The script will consult the whitelist before greylisting an entry.
The whitelist contains one column each for sending ip, sending email
address and recipient email address.

The ip column can either contain the exact ip address, or the first
three octets representing the class C network you wish to whitelist.
The sender and recipient columns can either contain an exact email
address or the domain part (including the @).

Bugs:

Please report any bugs you find to Mattias Amnefelt <mattiasa@stacken.kth.se>

This software is based on greylist-python which has been placed in the
public domain by it's author Vsevolod Sipakov <versus@megalink.ru>
